      <h1>Geopolitical Risk & Metals — Static Visualization Gallery</h1>
      <p>This gallery presents six figures examining how the Geopolitical
         Risk Index (GPRD) relates to gold and silver prices in financial markets.
        It includes the GPRD time series, monthly dynamics for both metals, and
        diagnostic charts that probe the relationships between geopolitical 
        risk and metal price movements.

       The Caldara and Iacoviello GPR index is based on searches of the archives
       of 10 newspapers: Chicago Tribune, the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times,
       The Globe and Mail, The Guardian, the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times,
       USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. 
       Caldara and Iacoviello calculate the index by counting the number 
       of articles related to adverse geopolitical events in each newspaper 
       for each month (as a share of the total number of news articles).
       
       The search is organized in eight categories: War Threats
       (Category 1), Peace Threats (Category 2), Military Buildups (Category 3),
       Nuclear Threats (Category 4), Terror Threats (Category 5), 
       Beginning of War (Category 6), Escalation of War (Category 7),
       Terror Acts (Category 8). Based on the search groups above, Caldara
       and Iacoviello also constructs two subindexes. 
       The Geopolitical Threats (GPRT) includes words belonging
       to categories 1 to 5 above. The Geopolitical Acts (GPRA) 
       index includes words belonging to categories 6 to 8.

              <p class="analysis">Notes:
                The GPRD series is characterized by long periods of relative calm
                punctuated by sharp, event-driven spikes. 

                The first major surge occurs in 1990–91 around Iraq’s invasion
                of Kuwait and the Gulf War. The largest shock in the sample
                arrives in 2001: the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent invasion
                of Afghanistan push the index to its peak, followed by
                a multi-year comedown but at a higher average level than the 
                1990s. 
                
                Through most of the 2010s the index hovers in a lower,
                stable band. A new regime shift appears in 2022 with Russia’s
                invasion of Ukraine, which generates the biggest spike
                since 2001 and leaves the post-2022 baseline elevated compared
                with the pre-COVID decade. Overall, the chart shows that
                geopolitical risk tends to revert after crises but
                does not fully return to prior lows, suggesting step-ups
                in the background level of perceived risk after major conflicts
                or terror events.

              <p class="analysis">Notes: 
                This figure shows the headline GPRD together with its
                two sub-indices—GPRD_ACT (realized geopolitical acts)
                and GPRD_THREAT (reported threats)—zoomed into the three windows
                that contain the largest surges in the sample
                (1990–95, 2000–05, 2020–25). Across all episodes
                (Kuwait/Gulf War, 9/11 & Afghanistan, and Russia–Ukraine),
                the THREAT component jumps first and to the highest magnitude,
                essentially driving the peak in the headline GPRD.
                The ACT component also rises around the event dates but with
                a smaller amplitude and often lags the threat spike.
                After the initial shock, both series decay, yet the pattern
                is consistent: threats contribute more to the size of the index
                spikes than realized acts, suggesting that expectations and
                uncertainty premium dominate the short-run dynamics of
                geopolitical risk.

                <strong>What this heatmap shows:</strong>
                Each vertical stripe is a month; color encodes the
                close-to-close % change (blue = gains, red = losses,
                intensity = magnitude).
                
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Silver is visibly more volatile than gold</strong></li>
                it contains many more dark blues/reds (large swings), 
                while gold is usually paler (smaller moves).
                <li><strong>Volatility clusters in a few regimes:</strong></li>
                <li>2008–2012 (global financial crisis/Eurozone stress)</li>
                shows repeated large moves, especially in silver.
                <li>2020–2022 (pandemic and Russia–Ukraine) brings synchronized
                spikes in both metals.</li>
                <li>Outside those regimes, monthly changes are mostly mild and
                alternating, suggesting rapid mean reversion rather than long
                streaks of one-sided returns</li>

                <strong>Overall, the heatmap summarizes 40 years of monthly action</strong>
                gold tends to be the steadier hedge, while silver exhibits
                larger, more episodic swings.

              <p class="analysis"></p>
              <p><strong>Summary.</strong>
                The correlation between geopolitical risk (GPRD) and gold’s monthly % change is
                <em>not stable</em>. 
                It flips sign across regimes and rarely stays high for long,
                indicating that shocks and market context shape the relationship more than a single
                persistent link.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Late 1980s–mid-1990s:</strong>
                    mostly positive but fading; turns negative around the early 1990s.</li>
                    <li><strong>Late 1990s–mid-2000s:</strong>
                    near zero to mildly negative on average, with brief spikes both ways.</li>
                    <li><strong>2008–2012 (post-GFC):</strong>
                    correlation rises and stays positive for a while,
                    peaking around ~0.5–0.6.</li>
                    <li><strong>2013–2019:</strong>
                    weak again (often near zero or slightly negative),
                    suggesting no consistent co-movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>2020–2024 (pandemic & war):</strong>
                    sharp oscillations from negative to positive and back,
                    reflecting alternating flight-to-safety and macro/liquidity
                    effects.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Takeaway.</strong> 
                There is <em>no persistent linear relationship</em> 
                between GPRD and gold MoM. Correlation is <em>regime-dependent</em>: 
                it tends to rise in the immediate aftermath of large crises
                (when risk aversion and safe-haven behavior dominate) and weakens
                or turns negative in calmer periods or when other macro
                forces (rates, USD, liquidity) overshadow
                geopolitical headlines.</p>

                This chart shows how the 12-month rolling correlation between 
                the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPRD) and monthly returns for
                <span style="color:#1f77b4;font-weight:600;">gold</span> (blue)
                and <span style="color:#ff7f0e;font-weight:600;">silver</span>
                (orange) evolves over time. Correlations are highly time-varying and hover around zero,
                indicating no stable long-run relationship; instead, short windows
                emerge when risk and metal returns move together (positive) or
                in opposite directions (negative).
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Volatility of the link:</b> 
                Both series swing between roughly +0.6 and −0.6. Silver’s line generally shows
                <em>larger amplitude</em> swings, suggesting its returns are more
                sensitive to risk shocks than gold’s.</li>
                <li><b>Positive windows:</b>
                Early 2000s and several episodes from ~2017–2020 and again
                around 2024 show positive correlation bursts—higher geopolitical
                risk aligning with stronger metal returns.</li>
                <li><b>Negative windows:</b> 1990–1992, ~1998–2001,
                    and ~2011–2013 feature sustained negatives, when rising
                    risk coincided with weaker (or opposite-moving)
                    metal returns.</li>
                <li><b>Recent behavior (2022–2025):</b>
                Both metals oscillate rapidly around zero with sharp dips
                and rebounds—consistent with fast, event-driven repricing.
                Gold shows sharper spikes; silver remains more volatile
                overall.</li>
                </ul>

                <b>Takeaway:</b> The GPRD–metals relationship is episodic. 
                Gold acts as the steadier hedge, while silver exhibits larger
                correlation swings and appears more reactive to geopolitical shocks.

                The figure compares the distribution of monthly close-to-close returns for
                <b>gold</b> (blue) and <b>silver</b>
                (orange) across three windows:
                <b>1990–1995</b>, <b>2000–2005</b>, and <b>2020–2025</b>.
                The vertical dashed line marks 0% (no change).
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Center near zero:</b> 
                In all periods, both metals are centered close to 0%,
                indicating no persistent monthly drift.</li>
                <li><b>Silver has fatter tails:</b> 
                Silver’s density is consistently wider with heavier tails,
                implying a higher probability of large gains or losses
                (±10% events are more common in silver).</li>
                <li><b>1990–1995:</b> Distributions are relatively tight;
                gold is the most compact, while silver already shows
                greater spread.</li>
                <li><b>2000–2005:</b> Volatility rises for both
                metals—particularly silver—with noticeably thicker
                positive and negative tails consistent with early-2000s
                shocks.</li>
                <li><b>2020–2025:</b> Dispersion remains elevated.
                Gold widens versus the 1990s, while silver continues
                to exhibit the broadest spread and the heaviest tails.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                <b>Takeaway:</b> Monthly returns for both metals cluster around
                zero, but <b>silver is systematically more volatile</b> 
                than gold across all periods, with a much higher 
                likelihood of extreme monthly moves.
