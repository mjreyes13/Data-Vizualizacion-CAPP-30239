# Altair Lab

For this assignment, you'll be working in a Jupyter notebook.

Open a terminal and run:

`uv run jupyter notebook altair_lab.ipynb`

Will start a browser session where you can work on the notebook.
You may also use the Jupyter plugin for your editor if you prefer.

## Submission

When you are done, ensure that your notebook is clean & readable.

Please take the following steps:

1. Move any scratch code either to another file or to the bottom and clearly mark it as such.
2. 'Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Run All' to ensure that your notebook executes in the order it is written.
    This is important because it is possible to run cells out of order during development, but we'd have no way of knowing which cells should run in which order.
3. You may want to use `ruff format altair_lab.ipynb` to tidy up your code automatically.
