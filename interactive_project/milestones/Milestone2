# World Illicit Drug Patterns Explorer

Maria Jose Reyes

## Goal

The core contribution of the project lies in placing trafficking flows and consumption patterns in a single analytic environment. This dual perspective makes it possible to explore questions such as: 
- Do shifts in trafficking routes coincide with changes in domestic consumption patterns? 
- Are countries that receive large quantities of trafficked drugs also experiencing rising prevalence among specific age groups? 
- Could supply-side disruptions or expansions be reflected in demographic shifts in use? 

While the project does not attempt to establish causality, the visualization could highlight temporal correlations, geographic overlaps and population impacts that may point to connections between trafficking behaviors and consumption outcomes.
